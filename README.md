Free fonts for desktop use collection
=========================================

This is my collection of free fonts that I continually use in my work, and I wanted to be able to easily sync them between my computers. I thought maybe this collection might be useful to others, so here they are.

Clone into your ~/.local/share/fonts directory

There is a post-update script that downloads fonts that are free to use but not redistributable. This does not check if a font is already downloaded, if anybody with bash-fu can improve on this script so that it downloads only newer files please create a pull request.

I have tried to be very thorough with checking each license before including it here, but I might have missed something, if I'm accidentally infringing on any copyrights, just drop me a message and I will remove non-free fonts immediately
